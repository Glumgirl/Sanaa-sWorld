        I’m Sanaa Asim, an interdisciplinary designer/researcher who loves thinking about place and space based in the UK. My background is in Modern Languages (German & Arabic)
        and Place-making.
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">
        As a designer, I’m interested in the ontological relationship between place and identity, 
        and how that can be acknowledged and incorporated into the co-design process.
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">
        Other than that, I spend my time reading, doing embroidery,
         dancing and whatever my latest hobby is (right now it’s letter writing!)
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">
        Some things I’ve been thinking about are: Hyperlinks, the meaning of “sacred”, neocities and online MMPORGs.

    <h2> About This Website</h2>
    <p class="paragraph">
         I hand-coded this website in HTML and CSS - I didn't really know either beforehand, but I feel an intense
            feeling of satisfaction being in complete control of my website, from its carbon footprint to the shade of cream I use for the 
            fonts. I recommend everyone try to make a website by hand at least once in their lives. Read more about my general initial feelings
            about website making on my <a href="https://sanaas.world/blogposts/02"> blog here</a>.
